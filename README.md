Master C Documentation with MkDocs & Doxygen (using the stunning MkDocs Material theme)

This step-by-step tutorial empowers you to write professional technical documentation for your C projects. Learn how to leverage the power of MkDocs for clean and modern documentation websites, and Doxygen for automatic API reference generation.

## What you'll learn

## Target Audience

- C Programmers (beginners or those looking to improve their documentation skills)
- Developers seeking to build well-documented C projects

## Things you need to know before getting start

This tutorial empowers you to craft professional C documentation with ease. We'll leverage two powerful tools:

- MkDocs Material: This popular theme is a powerful documentation framework on top of MkDocs. It allows you focus on the content of your documentation and create a professional static site in minutes. No need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript â€“ let Material for MkDocs do the heavy lifting for you
- Doxygen: This tool automates the creation of detailed API reference documentation from your C code comments, saving you significant time and effort.

### Our Unique Approach

While these tools are powerful, they don't natively integrate. This tutorial addresses this by using a custom Python script that bridges the gap between Doxygen and MkDocs Material. This script ensures seamless integration and a unified user experience for your C documentation.
